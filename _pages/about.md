I am a second-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/"> Mila </a> and <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/"> McGill University</a>, 
supervised by Prof.<a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/"> Jackie Chi Kit Cheung</a>. Before coming to Montreal, I received my bachelor's degree with a major in software engineering from <a href="https://www.neu.edu.cn/"> Northeastern University (China) </a> in 2019.

My current research focus on text summarization and knowledge distillation.
