I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/"> Quebec AI Institute (Mila) </a> and <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/"> McGill University</a>, supervised by Prof.<a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/"> Jackie Chi Kit Cheung</a>. I am a member of the <a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/">Reasoning and Learning (RL) lab</a>. Before coming to Montréal, I received my bachelor's degree with a major in software engineering from Northeastern University (China) in 2019.

My research interests span a wide range of areas within the field of artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). I am particularly focused on investigating and mitigating the issue of "hallucination" in neural text generation systems, and I am also dedicated to designing more effective RL algorithms for text generation. I interned at Google Research (Mountain View), Microsoft Research (Montréal), Borealis AI (Toronto), and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab (Montréal) during my PhD.
