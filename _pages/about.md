I'm currently a PhD student in [computer science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/){:target="_blank"} fortunate to be advised by [Jackie Chi Kit Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/){:target="\_blank"} and colleagues at [Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/mila/team/){:target="_blank"}.

I'm interested in how computers might better [understand](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238){:target="_blank"} natural language, especially when understanding requires [general world knowledge](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/1624775.1624816){:target="_blank"} and [systematic reasoning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027788900315){:target="_blank"} about this knowledge.
