I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/"> Quebec AI Institute (Mila) </a> and <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/"> McGill University</a>, supervised by Prof.<a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/"> Jackie Chi Kit Cheung</a>. I am a member of the <a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/">Reasoning and Learning (RL) lab</a>. Before coming to Montréal, I received my bachelor's degree with a major in software engineering from <a href="https://www.neu.edu.cn/"> Northeastern University (China) </a> in 2019.

I am broadly interested in deep learning, natural language processing and reinforcement learning. My primary research interests are in abstractive text summarization and conditional text generation. I interned at Microsoft Research (Montréal), Borealis AI, and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab during my PhD.
